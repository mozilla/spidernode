/*
 * This is a regression test for https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/15447
 * and https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/9333.
 *
 * When a timer is added in another timer's callback, its underlying timer
 * handle was started with a timeout that was actually incorrect.
 *
 * The reason was that the value that represents the current time was not
 * updated between the time the original callback was called and the time
 * the added timer was processed by timers.listOnTimeout. That led the
 * logic in timers.listOnTimeout to do an incorrect computation that made
 * the added timer fire with a timeout of scheduledTimeout +
 * timeSpentInCallback.
 *
 * This test makes sure that a timer added by another timer's callback
 * fires with the expected timeout.
 *
 * It makes sure that it works when the timers list for a given timeout is
 * empty (see testAddingTimerToEmptyTimersList) and when the timers list
 * is not empty (see testAddingTimerToNonEmptyTimersList).
